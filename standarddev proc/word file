Structured Development Process
This document outlines the steps followed in developing the quiz game.
1. Problem Definition
The goal was to build an interactive command-line quiz application that meets the following criteria:
•	Contains 10 questions.
•	Provides a scoring system that tracks performance throughout the quiz.
2. Requirement Analysis
The functional requirements identified for the application were:
•	Display a greeting and ask the user if they wish to start the quiz.
•	Begin only if the user responds “yes.”
•	Present 10 multiple-choice questions, one at a time.
•	Prompt the user to enter an answer (a, b, c, or d).
•	Validate the answer and give immediate feedback (Correct/Incorrect).
•	Maintain a running score.
•	Show the final score at the end of the quiz.
3. Top-Down Design / Modularization
To ensure clarity and maintainability, the program was divided into functions:
•	main(): Entry point of the program. Handles the welcome message, start prompt, and calls the quiz function.
•	run_quiz(): Core function containing the question data, quiz loop, input handling, answer validation, and score calculation.
This modular approach separates the quiz logic from the overall program flow.
4. Algorithm Development
•	Data Structure: A list of dictionaries was used to store questions. Each dictionary includes the question text, available options, and the correct answer.
•	Program Flow:
1.	Start in main().
2.	Prompt the user to begin. Exit if “no,” otherwise call run_quiz().
3.	Initialize score = 0.
4.	Loop through the list of questions.
5.	Display the question and options.
6.	Use a loop to validate input (must be a, b, c, or d).
7.	Compare input with the correct answer.
8.	Provide feedback and update score if correct.
9.	After all questions, display the final score.
5. Implementation
•	Language: Python 3.
•	Libraries: sys was used for clean program exit if the user chooses not to play.
•	Input Handling: User input is converted to lowercase and stripped of whitespace to handle variations like “Yes,” “ yes,” or “A.”
6. Testing and Refinement
The application was tested manually to confirm all requirements were met:
•	Start Prompt: Tested with “yes,” “no,” “YES,” “ no ”, and invalid inputs.
•	Answer Validation: Checked with correct answers, incorrect answers, and invalid inputs (e.g., “e,” “hello”).
•	Scoring: Verified by completing the quiz with known correct answers.
•	Refinement: Improved feedback messages by showing the correct answer when the user was wrong.
